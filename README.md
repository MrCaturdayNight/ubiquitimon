# Ubiquiti Monitor
Monitor for Ubiquiti device availability and send a notification via Pushover.

Copy config.py.example to config.py and modify any appropriate variables.

I execute with screen python3 monitor.py.

Output will be logged to monitor.log and if your item is in stock you should get notified via Pushover if you've configured it properly.
